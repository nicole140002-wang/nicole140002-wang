## 📌 Selected Projects

### 🏘 Christchurch Student Housing Walk-Accessibility (2025)
- Built a **network-based walk accessibility model** using Python/Jupyter (GeoPandas, OSMnx, NetworkX).
- Generated travel-time isochrones (to UC, schools, bus stops) and a composite **Housing Suitability map**.
- Delivered reproducible notebooks: data harmonisation → network analysis → overlay → maps → stats → export.

### 🌲 Foundations of GIScience (GISC401, 2025)
- **Cass field campaign**: GPS cleaning & travel behaviour analysis; drone imagery classification (GEOBIA + SVM).  
- **Ski-resort siting**: Raster suitability mapping with DEM & distance-to-road rasters.  
- **School exposure**: Built buffers & nearest-distance metrics to assess school exposure to retailers.  
- **Ames Housing (Python)**: EDA, regression models, RainCloud plots.

### 🌍 Spatial Analysis (GISC404/STAT450, 2025)
- Computed **Moran’s I/LISA** for NZ deprivation data; mapped Christchurch vs Wellington disparities.  
- Benchmarked **spatial regression models** (OLS vs SAR/SEM/Spatial Error, GWR).  
- Applied **Kriging & variogram modeling** with cross-validation error metrics.  
- Compared cluster detection between **GRASS GIS & SaTScan**.  

---

### 🌦 Environmental & Climate Data Analytics (GISC405, 2025)
- Built pipelines to process **WRF NetCDF climate data** with xarray.  
- Implemented functions to generate **wind climatologies & rainfall maps**.  
- Applied **Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)** for Fire Weather Index extremes & future climate projections (CCAM).  

---

### 📊 Big Data (STAT448, 2025)
- Applied **regularized regression (Ridge/LASSO/Elastic Net)**, SVM, Random Forest, and Boosting.  
- Built **CNN/transfer learning models** with Keras.  
- Explored **vector similarity search** for geospatial feature matching.
