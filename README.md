- Identified spatial clusters to support policy-making and public health insights.  

**Housing Price Regression (UC, 2025)**  
GitHub Repo: (repo coming soon)  
- Applied regression models (OLS, SEM, GWR) to urban housing datasets.  
- Benchmarked model performance, interpreting spatial dependence in property prices.  

**Environmental & Climate Data Analytics (UC, 2025)**  
GitHub Repo: (repo coming soon)  
- Processed WRF NetCDF datasets (2000‚Äì2020, 2030‚Äì2050) with Python & xarray.  
- Applied Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) to analyze Fire Weather Index extremes, generating >90th-percentile hotspot maps for disaster planning.  

**Foundations of GIScience (UC, 2025)**  
GitHub Repo: (repo coming soon)  
- Processed multispectral imagery (ENVI & Erdas) and DEM slope/aspect analysis (ArcGIS).  
- Conducted land-cover classification mapping using GEOBIA/SVM.  

**Geovisual Analytics (UC, 2025)**  
GitHub Repo: (repo coming soon)

- Created cartographic layouts (e.g., NZ population change, Political Map of Africa).  

**Spatial Analysis (UC, 2025)**  
GitHub Repo: (repo coming soon)  
- Evaluated Kriging models (exponential/gaussian) against IDW baselines with cross-validation.  
- Computed Moran‚Äôs I and LISA maps to assess spatial clustering and policy implications.
