## 📌 Selected Projects
- **[Student Housing Accessibility in Christchurch](https://github.com/nicole140002-wang/student-housing-accessibility-christchurch)** (UC, 2025)  
  Network-based accessibility model in Python (GeoPandas, OSMnx, NetworkX).  
  Evaluated 15-min school, 40-min UC, and bus stop walkability.  
  Produced composite suitability maps, highlighting top housing zones (Jellie Park, Ilam, Fendalton).  

- **NZ Deprivation Index Hotspot Mapping (UC, 2025)**  
  Computed Moran’s I and LISA maps to analyze socio-economic inequalities in Christchurch & Wellington.  
  Identified spatial clusters to support policy-making and public health insights.  

- **Housing Price Regression (Python, 2025)**  
  Applied regression models (OLS, SEM, GWR) to urban housing datasets.  
  Benchmarked model performance, interpreting spatial dependence in property prices.  

- **Climate & Fire Weather Analysis (UC, 2025)**  
  Processed WRF NetCDF data with xarray to build NZ wind/temperature/rainfall climatologies.  
  Applied **Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)** to evaluate Fire Weather Index extremes (2000–2050).  
  Generated hotspot maps to support disaster planning.  

- **Remote Sensing & Land Cover Classification (UC, 2025)**  
  Classified UAV imagery with GEOBIA & SVM.  
  Conducted NDVI-based vegetation monitoring in Google Earth Engine.  
  Applied kriging for environmental data interpolation.
